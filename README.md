🍽️ Menu-Based Food Ordering Website

A simple and interactive menu-based food ordering website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to browse food items, add or remove them from a cart, and automatically calculate the total order cost.

📌 Project Overview

The rapid growth of web technologies has increased the demand for digital food ordering systems.
This project focuses on developing a front-end web application that provides a smooth and user-friendly food ordering experience without page reloads.

It is designed as an academic project under Fundamentals of DevOps (INT 331) and also demonstrates practical usage of Git and GitHub for version control.

🎯 Objectives

Design a menu-based food ordering website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Allow users to add and remove food items from a cart
